            <p>I'm basically sick of the British Fencing calendar not having all events on it. This idea isn't perfect but its a way around certain problems:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Don't want to / aren't able to pay BF to put your event on the Calendar</li>
              <li>Don't have the skill set to handle creating a website for your event</li>
              <li>Online payments are tricky and you don't want to touch them with a barge pole</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The idea is that this should make running a competition easier (in terms of online presense) and should make it easier for fencers to enter. </p>

            <h4>Basic premise</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>Competition organiser creates event (name, venue, type, category, entry fee etc)</li>
              <li>Fencer creates their profile (name, weapons fenced, license number, location etc</li>
              <li>Fencer searches for competitions (either by weapons offered, location, celtic passport, anything we can think of</li>
              <li>Fencer enteres competition</li>
              <li>Competition organiser can see live update of entry lists, download list, see who has valid licenses etc</li>
            </ol>
          </section>
